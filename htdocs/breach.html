                        <span class="bold">Biography</span>: This is retrieved from the official Valorant description of breach, "Breach, the bionic Swede, fires powerful, targeted kinetic blasts to aggressively clear a path through enemy ground. The damage and disruption he inflicts ensures no fight is ever fair."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">Appearance</span>: Breach is the tallest agent in Valorant and appears to have robotic arms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">Personality</span>: Breach is an arrogant agent. He just wants to smash through every wall he faces and does not care about any danger.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Abilities</h2>

                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">Fault Line</span>: This is Breach's signiture ability, meaning that it's free every round. It also recharges every 35 seconds. Once activated by "E", Breach EQUIPS a seismic blast. HOLD FIRE to increase the distance. RELEASE to set off the quake, dazing all players in its zone and in a line up to the zone. Once dazed, enemies move and shoot slower, and has blurry and moving vision.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">Flashpoint</span>: Breach can use this ability twice a round and costs 200. Once activated by "Q", Breach EQUIPS a blinding charge. FIRE the charge to set a fast-acting burst through the wall. The charge detonates to blind all players looking at it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">Aftershock</span>: This is the only ability that damages other players that Breach have. Once activated with "C", Breach EQUIPS a fusion charge. FIRE the charge to set a slow-acting burst through the wall. The burst does heavy damage to anyone caught in its area. An enemy will die if he/she is hit 3 times by this blast.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">Rolling Thunder</span>: This is Breach's ultimate ability. It is very like Fault Line, but it has a wider range and longer daze. Once activated with "X", Breach EQUIPS a seismic charge. FIRE to send a cascading quake through all terrain in a large line. The quake dazes and knocks up anyone caught in it. This ability can knock up an entire site and can be used for post plants (after the spike is planted)!

                    <li>In attacking side, Breach is the initiator of fights. He blinds areas most commonly peeked by enemies, concusses enemies to slow them down, and clears small corners with his Aftershock. He rushes towards the back of the site and tries to gain control of the site. Once the spike is planted, Breach buys time for the spike to detonate. Breach is very aggressive in attacking side.</li> 
                    <li>When defending, breach is supportive. With his concuss and blind, enemies can be killed by Breach's teammates. Concuss also works great with mollies and grenades.</li>

                <p>These is a demonstration of the playstyle of Breach.
                Breach is very aggressive. Although he is not a duelist,
                he can still make some clutch and amazing plays.</p>
